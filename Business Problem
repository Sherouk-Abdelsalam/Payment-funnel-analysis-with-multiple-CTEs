# Payment-funnel-analysis-with-multiple-CTEs
A payment funnel analysis to understand the furthest point in the payment process users are getting to and where users are falling out of the process.  

Here's the payment process a user goes through when signing up for a subscription:  
 The user opens the widget to initiate the payment process. (STATUSID 1)  
 The user types in credit card information. (STATUSID 2) 
 The user clicks the submit button to complete their part of the payment process. (STATUSID 3) 
 The product sends the data to the third-party payment processing company. (STATUSID 4) 
 The payment company completes the transaction and reports back with "complete." (STATUSID 5) 
 Error (STATUSID is 0)
 
As subscriptions move through the statuses, the movements are logged in the "paymentstatuslog" table using the "statusid". 
Users can go back and forth and move through statuses multiple times.  Users move through a few statuses, hit an error, restart the process, and then finally complete their payment. 

Users' current status can be found on table "subscriptions".
